## 🐛 CRITICAL FIXES RESOLVED

### 1. **OpenAI Library Compatibility** ([#150165](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/150165))
**Issue:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'ResponseFormatJSONSchema'`
- **Root Cause**: Version conflicts with Extended OpenAI Conversation and other integrations
- **Solution**: Flexible version requirements + fallback implementations
- **Result**: Works alongside any OpenAI-based integration

### 2. **Model Parsing Errors** ([#149905](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/149905))  
**Issue:** `'audio' is not a valid Modality` and architecture parsing failures
- **Root Cause**: New OpenRouter model types not supported by python-open-router library
- **Solution**: Safe parsing with direct API fallback + individual model skipping
- **Result**: All OpenRouter models load successfully

### 3. **AI Tasks API Failures** ([#150294](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/150294))
**Issue:** "Error talking to API" for all AI task operations
- **Root Cause**: Multiple compatibility and parsing issues combined
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error handling + better API communication
- **Result**: AI tasks work reliably with all supported models

---

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### **Robust Architecture**
- **Flexible Dependencies**: `openai>=1.99.5,<2.0.0` prevents version conflicts
- **Safe Model Loading**: Direct API calls when library parsing fails  
- **Non-blocking Errors**: Individual model failures don't crash the integration
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for troubleshooting

### **Vision Implementation**
- **Multi-part Messages**: Text + image content in single API calls
- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Automatic base64 conversion and validation
- **Format Detection**: Smart handling of different image sources
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when image processing fails
